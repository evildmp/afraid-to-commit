**Git** is a source code management system, designed to support collaboration.

**GitHub** is a web-based service that hosts Git projects, including Django
itself: https://github.com/django/django.

Git is a quite remarkable tool. It's fearsomely complex, but you can start
using it effectively without needing to know very much about it. All you really
need is to be familiar with some basic operations.

The key idea in Git is that it's *distributed*. If you're not already familiar
with version control systems, then explaining why this is important will only
introduce distinctions and complications that you don't need to worry about,
so that's the last thing I will say on the subject.
