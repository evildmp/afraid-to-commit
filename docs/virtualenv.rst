Virtualenv and pip
##################

In this section you will:

*	use pip to install packages
*	install virtualenv
*	create and destroy, activate and deactivate virtual environments
*	use ``pip freeze`` to show installed items

What is virtualenv?
===================

**Virtualenv** lets you create and manage virtual Python environments.

If you're running a Python project for deployment or development, the chances
are that you'll need more than one version of it, or the numerous other Python
applications it depends upon, to at any one time.

For example, when a new version of Django is released, you might want to check
your project is still compatible. You don't want to have to set up a whole new
server with a different version of Django to find out.

With virtualenv, you can quickly set up a a brand new Python environment, and
install your components into it - along with the new version of Django,
without touching or affecting what you already have running.

You can have literally dozens of virtualenvs on the same machine, all running
different versions of your Python software, all independently of each other,
and can safely make changes to one without affecting anything else.

**pip** goes hand-in-hand with virtualenv; in fact, it comes with virtualenv
(as well as separately). It's an installer, and is the easiest way to install
things into a virtualenv.


Install virtualenv
==================

Try::

    virtualenv --version
    
Do you have a version lower than 1.9? Upgrade it::

    sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv
    hash -r # purge shell's PATH, though this may not be necessary for you
    
If you got a "Command not found" when you tried to use virtualenv, try::

    sudo pip install virtualenv
    
or::

    sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv # for a Debian-based system - but
    it may not be up-to-date
    
If that fails or you're using a different system, you might need more help:

Create and activate a virtual environment
=========================================

::

    virtualenv my-first-virtualenv
    cd my-first-virtualenv
    source bin/activate

Notice how your command prompt tells you that the virtualenv is active (and it remains active even while you're not in its directory)::

    (my-first-virtualenv)~/my-first-virtualenv$ 

Using pip
=========

pip freeze
----------

``pip freeze`` lists installed Python packages:: 

    (my-first-virtualenv)daniele@v029:~/my-first-virtualenv$ pip freeze 
    argparse==1.2.1
    distribute==0.6.24
    pyasn1==0.1.7
    virtualenv==1.9.1
    wsgiref==0.1.2
    
pip install
----------- 

Earlier, you may have used ``sudo pip install``. You **don't** need ``sudo``
now, because you're in a virtualenv. Let's install something.

::

    pip install rsa

pip will visit PyPI, the Python Package Index, and will install Python-RSA (a
"Pure-Python RSA implementation"). It will also install its dependencies -
things it needs - if any have been listed at PyPI.

Now see what ``pip freeze`` reports. And try::

    (my-first-virtualenv)~/my-first-virtualenv$ python 
    Python 2.7.2+ (default, Jul 20 2012, 22:15:08) 
    [GCC 4.6.1] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import rsa

To uninstall it::

    pip uninstall rsa

To install a particular version::

    pip install rsa==3.0
    
To ugrade the package to the latest version::

    pip install --upgrade rsa 
            
Where packages get installed
----------------------------

Your virtualenv has a site-packages directory, in the same way your system does. So now rsa can be found in::

    ~/my-first-virtualenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rsa
    
(It's possible that you'll have a different version of Python listed in that
path.)
    
Dependencies
------------

Python-RSA doesn't have any dependencies, but if it did, and if those
dependencies had dependencies, pip would install them all.

So if all the package authors have done a good job of informing PyPI about
their software's requirements, you can install a Django application, for
example, and pip will will install it, and Django, and possibly dozens of other
pieces of software, all into your virtualenv, and without your having to make
sure that everything required is in place.

Managing virtualenvs
====================

Create a second virtualenv
--------------------------

::

    cd ~/ # it would be silly to create a virtualenv inside another
    virtualenv my-second-virtualenv
    cd my-second-virtualenv
    source bin/activate # activate it, and deactivate the other one 

``pip freeze`` will show you that you haven't installed Python-RSA in this one -
it's a completely different Python environment from the other, and both are
isolated from the system-wide Python setup.

Deactivate a virtualenv
-----------------------

::

    deactivate
    
Now you're no longer in any virtualenv.       

--install-site-packages
-----------------------

When you create a virtualenv, it doesn't include any Python packages already
installed on your system. But sometimes, that *is* what you want. In that
case::

    virtualenv --install-site-packages my-third-virtualenv 
    
remove a virtualenv
-------------------

virtualenvs are disposable. You can get rid of these::

    cd ~/
    rm -r  my-first-virtualenv my-second-virtualenv my-third-virtualenv
    
And that's pretty much all you need to get started and to use pip and
virtualenv effectively.
